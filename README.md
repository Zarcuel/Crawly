Crawly
Crawly is a fast, parallel processing web scanner that crawls websites to detect privacy-impacting elements like tracking cookies, social media embeds, and analytics scripts using Playwright and BeautifulSoup. It can also run in scraper mode to search for specific keywords or file types (like *.pdf or token) across a site.

Features
üîç Detects tracking cookies, social media plugins, analytics tools, and suspicious domains

üîé Scraper mode: search for custom strings or patterns like "login" or "*.pdf"

‚ö° Fast, multithreaded scanning with ThreadPoolExecutor

üé≠ Uses Playwright to simulate real browser visits and collect JavaScript-set cookies

üß† Smart filtering of URLs and crawl depth

üíæ Save raw scan results to JSON for re-export

‚ôªÔ∏è Re-export CSVs with different filters without rescanning

‚èπÔ∏è Gracefully stop crawling by pressing q and proceed to scanning

üìÑ Outputs results to a CSV for easy review
